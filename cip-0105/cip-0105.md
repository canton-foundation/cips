# CIP 0105:  Canton Network University Program

# Abstract

This CIP proposes a multi-phase University Program led by Cantor8 to expand awareness, education, and application development within the Canton ecosystem through partnerships with leading global universities.
The program will introduce students, researchers, and early-stage founders to the Canton Network and the Daml smart contract platform through lectures, hackathons, fellowships, incubator support, and specialized training. Over time, Canton-related content will be integrated into academic curricula and research programs.
The goal is to build a long-term talent pipeline, increase ecosystem adoption, and accelerate production-ready applications on Canton.
Super Validator weight will be earned through an escrow-based, milestone-driven structure tied to measurable outcomes such as university participation, fellowship deployment, program scale, application launches, and research integration, with rewards released only upon verified completion.


# Overview

The Cantor8 University Program is structured into three phases executed over approximately three years:

Phase I — Awareness & Development (2026): Establish broad awareness and early builder excitement.

Phase II — Specialization (2027): Deepen expertise, build a founder/incubator funnel, and create a talent pipeline.

Phase III — Full Academic Integration (2028): Embed Canton/Daml into curricula and establish sustained research capacity.

## Phase I — Awareness & Development
Lectures & Talks

Objective: Establish baseline understanding among students and university communities: what Canton is, what problems it solves, and why it matters.

Format:

Guest talks and lectures hosted at leading universities.

Content to cover Canton fundamentals, real-world adoption pathways (esp. TradFi), and ecosystem opportunities.

Potential speaker categories:

Leaders from the Canton ecosystem (e.g., ecosystem founders/executives)

Political / regulatory leaders

Web2/Web3 founders & executives

Example universities and timeline:

Spring 2026 (confirmed): University of Cambridge; University of Oxford

Spring 2027 (tentative): Stanford University; UC Berkeley

Spring 2028 (tentative): Harvard University; MIT

Hackathons & Competitions

Objective: Create a developer and founder pipeline by running high-signal competitions with meaningful prizes and ecosystem-aligned judging.

Format:

Hackathons at individual universities or multi-university programs.

Problem statements selected to match ecosystem priorities at the time, incorporating input from the Canton Foundation and broader community.

Confirmed for Spring 2026:

Joint hackathon (Oxford, Cambridge, Imperial College) at Cadogan Hall, London.

Berkeley hackathon at Berkeley Stadium.

Planned for 2027/28:

Yale, Stanford, Harvard, MIT (tentative).

Judges/adjudicators may include:

Cantor8

Canton Foundation

Digital Asset

Cumberland

Citadel Securities

Wintermute

Prizes may include:

Cash prizes

Start-up funding & support

Roles and internships within the Canton ecosystem

Fellowship / Ambassador Programs

Objective: Maintain an incentivized on-campus presence and create reliable communication channels between universities and the ecosystem.

### Structure:

Target: 2 fellows per university, paid monthly, minimum 1-year term.

Roles:

Fellow A (Market/Business): spreads market and career opportunities; bridges TradFi/market-facing narratives.

Fellow B (Technical): spreads developer understanding; supports technical workshops; potentially drives research.

University blockchain societies (or equivalent) act as operational partners for local event delivery and promotion.

## Phase II — Specialization
Focused Lecture Series

Objective: Deliver advanced, high-value education for specialized students and executives (e.g., business schools), featuring experts with insights not easily available online.

Format:

Smaller, topic-specific sessions: protocol architecture, privacy model, Daml patterns, tokenization, compliance, scaling, etc.

Potential speakers (examples):

Eric Sarieniecki

Chris Zuhelke

Shaul Kfir

Robin Krom

Andreas Lochibler

Canton Network Incubator

 Objective: Build an ongoing incubation pipeline for founders emerging from partner universities.

### Cantor8 responsibilities:

Communicate ecosystem needs so founders target real problems.

Provide multi-avenue support (funding, development help, network access).

Ensure Canton ecosystem funds/VCs gain structured access to high-caliber founders/projects.

Talent Pipeline

Objective: Convert student interest into internships, placements, and full-time hires at Canton-adjacent organizations.

Mechanisms (via university collaboration):

Promote job opportunities through newsletters, communities, and events.

Provide employer visibility and priority presence at events.

Improve student understanding of Canton’s long-term potential and career pathways.

### Target milestone:

20+ high-quality applications or 3+ job placements (per defined program period).

Bootcamps & Intensive Programs

Objective: Upskill students and builders through 1–4 week intensives.

### Goals:

Upskill future workforce and builders.

Convert side projects into research/start-ups.

Increase quality applications into ecosystem organizations.

## Phase III — Full Academic Integration
Inclusion in Course Curricula

Objective: Make Canton-focused education part of formal academic curricula (new modules or integration into existing courses).

Potential topics:

Daml smart contract language

Protocol upgrades: cryptography, scaling improvements

Canton’s role in traditional finance

Legal/process aspects of RWA tokenization

Research Labs

Objective: Establish dedicated academic capacity for cutting-edge Canton and blockchain research.

### Target:

Establish at least two dedicated blockchain research labs at partner universities.

Deliverables and SV Weighting

This CIP defines deliverables with associated SV Weight incentives, subject to Foundation/working group verification.

| #  | Deliverable | Description | SV Weight | Time |
|----|------------|------------|-----------|------|
| 1 | Fellows Program | Create a Canton Fellows Program (Approved by Foundation). 8+ fellows across minimum 3 universities. | +0.5 | +90 Days |
| 1 | Fellows Adoption Bonus | Conduct competitive selection and award 3+ Canton Fellowships across a minimum of 3 Foundation-approved Universities. | +0.5 | +180 Days (?) |
| 2 | Educational Programme | Establish Canton presence at a Top 25 World Ranked University and create a continuous programme including: 1 yearly large lecture (100+ attendees), 1 yearly hackathon, 5–7 subject lectures yearly, 5–7 technical workshops (2026/2027), Summer Schools (2026/2027). | +1 | +360 Days |
| 2 | Educational Programme Adoption Bonus | Expand into at least 2 more leading Universities. | +0.25 per University (Max +1) | — |
| 3 | Incubation Programme | Partner with Canton Foundation & Ecosystem Fund to create Incubator. 5+ applications released in 2026. | +0.5 per Featured App in Production exceeding $1m fees (Max +2) | +2 Years |

| 4 | Termination Clause | If programmes stop after milestones are achieved, the SV Weight will be revoked going forward. | Up to max reward | — |


### SV Reward Mechanics

This CIP proposes the following escrow-based reward mechanics:

An extraBeneficiary PartyID associated with an “escrowed” Super Validator is set up by the Foundation (or an approved SV operator providing escrow services), with SV Weight set to the maximum earnable weight.

Applicant coordinates setup with the GSF and escrow SV operator and covers operation costs.

Escrow SV does not mint block-by-block; rewards flow to the Unclaimed Rewards pool.

⅔ of SV operators update configurations to allow the escrow SV to host the full earnable weight.

Applicant submits proof of completed milestones to the Tokenomics Working Group, including a calculation of CC earned.

If the Tokenomics Working Group approves, an announcement is sent via the Tokenomics-Announce mailing list.

GSF updates extraBeneficiary to an active PartyID controlled by the Super Validator.

⅔ of SV operators assign Unclaimed Rewards to be minted by the applicant’s validator based on the approved calculation.

If milestones are not met by deadlines:

Applicant is notified by GSF.

Remaining escrow SV Weight is removed from GSF node config; GSF SV total weight reduced by the same amount via SV vote.

Tokenomics Working Group recommends how to handle Unclaimed Rewards.

## Motivation

Canton’s success depends on (i) high-quality builders, (ii) credible institutional understanding, and (iii) a strong pipeline from education → innovation → employment.

The world’s leading universities are leverage points for all three:

They generate founders disproportionately.

They influence regulators and institutions through research and alumni networks.

They are where talent pipelines are formed early.

This program creates structured pathways for awareness, education, and adoption—while aligning output to ecosystem needs (apps, hires, research).

## Rationale

The three-phase design is intended to:

Start broad, then deepen: Phase I builds awareness at scale; Phase II converts interest into expertise and production output; Phase III makes it durable through curricula and labs.

Create compounding effects: Fellows sustain momentum between events; hackathons feed the incubator; incubator outputs feed talent pipelines; formal curricula stabilize the long-term base.

Align incentives with measurable outcomes: Deliverables are milestone-driven and tied to SV Weight, with an escrow mechanism and revocation clause to reduce drift and ensure accountability.
